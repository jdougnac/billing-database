# billing-database
A simple fictional billing database, with a python script to make operation simpler

The files on the 'billing' folder are the database proper. 

Launcher.py has the complex operations, while query.py has the simple operations that make those complex operations work. 

Finally, bd.png shows the diagram for the database.
